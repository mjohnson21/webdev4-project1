STEP THREE - PROJECT

1. Initial Setup
Get a fresh copy of Bootstrap 3 and HTML5 Boilerplate. Integrate these in a fresh directory. Make sure the Bootstrap build has LESS integrated with it. We'll be working on a 12 column fluid grid for this project.

2. Separate Bootstraps LESS system
Move the Bootstrap LESS build into it's own directory inside of the LESS directory. Create a file called main.less, and import bootstrap/bootstrap.less into this.


DESIGN INFO
The main brand font used for this site is Monsterrat, available from Google Fonts. All body copy should be in an Arial/Helvetica/sans-serif stack.

Here are the colors used for links and many other components.
@colorBrand: 			#ffb302; // Gold
@colorAccent: 			#ff9d01; // Darker gold


HEADER
The header is now 60px tall. Find the variable for this, and implement it in your main.less file. The background gradient is from #333 to #000. The Jeep logo is available in the header-sprite.png file. Active states have a 4px gold border at the top.


FOOTER
Gradient from #222 to #111. Border at the top is #444. Font size is 12px for links and disclaimers with headers that are white.


OTHER NOTES
Use mixins for all gradients and code you find yourself using more than twice.
