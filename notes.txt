Get a fresh copy of Bootstrap 3 and HTML5 Boilerplate. Integrate these in a fresh directory. Make sure the Bootstrap build has LESS integrated with it. We'll be working on a 12 column fluid grid for this project.

Move the Bootstrap LESS build into it's own directory inside of the LESS directory. Create a file called main.less, and import bootstrap/bootstrap.less into this.
